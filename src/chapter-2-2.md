Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an essential tool for small business decision making, enabling businesses to optimize processes, enhance customer experience, and make more informed choices. In this chapter, we will explore the three types of AI used for decision making: Narrow or Weak AI, General or Strong AI, and Super AI.

Narrow or Weak AI
-----------------

Narrow or weak AI is designed to perform a specific task. This type of AI is the most commonly used type of AI in small business decision making. Examples of narrow or weak AI include virtual personal assistants, image recognition software, and recommendation systems.

Narrow or weak AI is programmed to perform a single function and cannot learn or adapt beyond its original programming. It works within a set of rules and can only respond based on pre-established criteria.

Small businesses can use narrow or weak AI to automate repetitive tasks, analyze data, and provide personalized recommendations. For example, an e-commerce business can use a recommendation system to suggest products to customers based on their purchase history and browsing behavior.

General or Strong AI
--------------------

General or strong AI refers to AI that can perform any intellectual task that a human can. Strong AI does not currently exist but is a hypothetical AI system with general cognitive ability at the human level or beyond.

General or strong AI would have the ability to think, reason, and learn like a human. This AI system would be able to understand and interpret complex information, communicate effectively with humans, and perform any task that a human could.

Small businesses cannot currently use this type of AI for decision making.

Super AI
--------

Super AI, also known as artificial superintelligence, refers to AI that surpasses human intelligence in all areas. Super AI is also hypothetical and raises ethical and existential concerns.

Super AI would have the ability to improve its own intelligence, leading to exponential growth in intelligence. This type of AI could potentially pose a threat to human existence if it decides to act against human interests.

Small businesses cannot currently use this type of AI for decision making.

Conclusion
----------

Understanding the different types of AI used for decision making is critical for small businesses to make informed decisions when implementing AI solutions. Narrow or weak AI is the most commonly used type of AI in small business decision making, enabling businesses to automate processes, analyze data, and provide personalized recommendations. General or strong AI and super AI are hypothetical AI systems that do not currently exist but raise ethical and existential concerns. In the following chapters, we will explore how small businesses can prepare for successful AI implementation, develop AI strategies that align with their business goals, and implement AI solutions effectively using narrow or weak AI.
